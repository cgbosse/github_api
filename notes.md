#Notes taken during the process

1. In tried to prepare VSCODE to be used with Python without much success.
   Using the following articles:
   - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57310009/how-to-install-a-new-python-module-on-vscode>
   - <https://windowsloop.com/how-to-add-to-windows-path/>
   
   While doing these steps I encountered the problem that while installing it would refer to a prior version of python that is installed on my computer.
2. I installed the PuGithub and requests following the indications from this article:

3. Installed JSON package for converting to more complex JSONs 
   1. <https://opensource.com/article/19/7/save-and-load-data-python-json>
   2.In order to view the JSON in Pycharm in a better format I learned to use the Ctrl+Alt+L command from this article.
